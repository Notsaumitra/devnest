Cascading Style Sheet
CSS means How a web page looks (style the webpage) while HTML is what a page has (content of page)

Selector{
 property:value;
}

External css in head tag add <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style/css"> (rel="stylesheet" is important otherwise it will not work)

Priority will be inline>>internal and external
Between internal and external whichever is written later is given more priority
Can be multiple external files but priority will be given to the newest one (one which is defined at last)

3 main selectors
Element selector
Id selector
Class selector

Id >> class >> element if one element is syled by 3 selectors
If 2 same type of selectors are targeting 1 element the one defined later in stylesheet is given priority
One element can have only 1 id

## padding -- space between boundary/border and content
padding : value; all sides
padding : value1 value2; value1=top,bottom and value2 = right-left
padding : value1 value2 value3 value4; value1=top value2=right value3=bottom value4=left trbl(trouble)

## margin -- space from origin position
for body there is some default margin
margin : value; all sides
margin : value1 value2; value1=top,bottom and value2 = right-left
margin : value1 value2 value3 value4; value1=top value2=right value3=bottom value4=left trbl(trouble)

border: type size color;
border-radius: 50%; // circle but we must specify width and height 

## em vs rem
default font size is 16px;
EM is relative to the parent element's font size,
so if you wish to scale the element's size based on its parent's size, use EM. 
REM is relative to the root (HTML) font size,
so if you wish to scale the element's size based on the root size,
no matter what the parent size is, use REM 
*** for RWD rem is used


if we give div some style say color:red
its children lets say p tag will inherit the color
eg font-size, color, etc.

display property is automatically set to block,inline 
block element takes 100% width eg.- div,p,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6
inline element takes only that much space which it needs eg.- a,span
if we add margin at top bottom it has no effect but left right we can give....
but if we add padding at all 4 sides top and bottom will overflow

display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.
display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.


inline-block we can set width and height on the element
